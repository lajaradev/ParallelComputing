<h2 align="center"> Parallel Computing OpenMP Image processing </h2>

<h6> 

The objective of this practice is to learn to program with the OpenMP paradigm for shared memory systems. An image in gray tones stored in a binary file with a raw extension will be read, that is, the data will be of the unsigned char type and the file size will be height x width x 1byte.

The read image will be stored in a two-dimensional matrix, the processed images will be stored in binary files in raw format, a process carried out by the sequential thread.

Processors to implement (one will be chosen by passing parameter):
Filtered by mean (3 x 3 items)
Filtered by median (3 x 3 items)
Edge detection (SOBEL)

The output text file, generated by the sequential thread, will contain the following information: input file name, image size, output file name, number of threads used, execution time (counted from when the image is in memory). until before starting to save the file with the processed image).

In edge detection by SOBEL, those elements that do not have the 8 SI neighbors will be considered, performing symmetric extension for both rows (row -1 will be equal to 1, row N will be equal to N-2, being N the number of rows) as for columns.

The names of the files and the rest of the necessary parameters (image size and type of processing) will be passed as arguments in the execution statement.


Compile Sentence:
➔ gcc -fopenmp -o omp_image OpenMP_processingImage.c -lm

Execution Sentence:
➔ ./omp_image lena4096x4096.raw average 4096 4096 5 exitAverage5.raw
